# TeploED Greenhouse Dashboard

TeploED is a simple web interface for monitoring and controlling a greenhouse. The project simulates sensor readings and hardware commands so you can explore the dashboard without real equipment.

## Features
- Dashboard showing temperature, humidity, light level and soil moisture.
- Action log that records each command sent to the simulated devices.
- Control panel with buttons for heater, lighting and watering systems.
- Settings section for adjusting thresholds (not yet persisted).
- Sensor values are refreshed every 5 seconds to mimic real time updates.

## Getting Started

2. Open `greenhouse.html` in your browser. You may also run a local server with `python3 -m http.server` and navigate to the page.
